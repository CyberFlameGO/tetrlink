discord linked role stuff for tetr.io stats, using cloudflare workers !!

ur gonna need the wrangler thingy, cf workers subdomain, mongodb cluster and uhh patience  
you first need to fill the things in `src/config.js` & `wrangler.toml` then run `node src/register.js` once, after that you can just deploy it
